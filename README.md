Solution for FrontEnd WEB3 Challenge

Required Endpoints:

```bash
Create a NextJS application that renders a button with text "Connect with MetaMask"

This button should open the MetaMask browser extension and let the user connect to the app using his MetaMask wallet.

Once connected, the application should also query the user's balance and display it.

Bonus (Optional): Perform the balance inquiry using a backend API. You may use Next JS API or any backend programming language.
